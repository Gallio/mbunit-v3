The SDK is required for generating HxS help files for integration into Visual Studio.

It is possible to install the SDK without Visual Studio.  Here is one way.

These instructions were derived from: http://www.helpware.net/mshelp2/h2faq.htm

1. Download and install the Win32 developer tools component of the Windows SDK.

2. Download and install a program that includes the MS HTML 2 shared components such as
   SQL Server Express Edition or Visual Studio Express Edition.

   Note: You can skip this step and still install the SDK.  However I have not tested
         whether there are any adverse side effects on the MS HTML 2 Help Compiler
         as a result.  If you try it out, let me know.  -- Jeff.

3. Download VsSDKFeburary2007.exe.   http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700819.aspx

4. Extract the SDK to a temporary folder using a tool such as WinRAR.

5. Run %PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\MsiDb.EXE.

   * Open VSSDK.msi file that was extracted in step 4.
   * Export the LaunchCondition element to the temporary directory.
   * Edit the LaunchCondition.idt file in the temporary directory and delete the following two lines:
       (DEVENV_DIR <> "") OR Installed Visual Studio 2005 SDK can only be installed on machines with Visual Studio 2005 installed.
       DEXPLORE_DIR [ProductName] requires MSHelp 2.0 to be installed. You can get it from Visual Studio and MSDN Library.
   * Import the modified LaunchCondition.idt file back into the MSI.
   * Quit MsiDb.

6. Run the altered VSSDK.msi installer.  It has now been altered to skip the Visual Studio check.
