        <member name="F:JetBrains.Interop.WinApi.Declarations.Constants.MemoryAllocationTypes.MEM_COMMIT">
            <summary>
            Allocates physical storage in memory or in the paging file on disk for the specified reserved memory pages. The function initializes the memory to zero.
            To reserve and commit pages in one step, call VirtualAlloc with MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE.
            The function fails if you attempt to commit a page that has not been reserved. The resulting error code is ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS.
            An attempt to commit a page that is already committed does not cause the function to fail. This means that you can commit pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page.
            </summary>
        </member>
        <member name="F:JetBrains.Interop.WinApi.Declarations.Constants.MemoryAllocationTypes.MEM_RESERVE">
            <summary>
            Reserves a range of the process's virtual address space without allocating any actual physical storage in memory or in the paging file on disk.
            You can commit reserved pages in subsequent calls to the VirtualAlloc function. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call VirtualAlloc with MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE.
            Other memory allocation functions, such as malloc and LocalAlloc, cannot use a reserved range of memory until it is released.

        </member>
        <member name="F:JetBrains.Interop.WinApi.Declarations.Constants.MemoryAllocationTypes.MEM_RESET">
            <summary>
            Indicates that data in the memory range specified by lpAddress and dwSize is no longer of interest. The pages should not be read from or written to the paging file. However, the memory block will be used again later, so it should not be decommitted. This value cannot be used with any other value.
            Using this value does not guarantee that the range operated on with MEM_RESET will contain zeroes. If you want the range to contain zeroes, decommit the memory and then recommit it.
            When you specify MEM_RESET, the VirtualAlloc function ignores the value of flProtect. However, you must still set flProtect to a valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS.
            VirtualAlloc returns an error if you use MEM_RESET and the range of memory is mapped to a file. A shared view is only acceptable if it is mapped to a paging file.

To reset the write-tracking state, call GetWriteWatch or ResetWriteWatch. The write-tracking feature remains enabled for the memory region until the region is freed.

            Pages in the region become guard pages. Any attempt to access a guard page causes the system to raise a STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION exception and turn off the guard page status. Guard pages thus act as a one-time access alarm. For more information, see Creating Guard Pages. 
            When an access attempt leads the system to turn off guard page status, the underlying page protection takes over.
            If a guard page exception occurs during a system service, the service typically returns a failure status indicator.

            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility

            […]
            It is a good idea to specify a large array of HMODULE values, because it is hard to predict how many modules there will be in the process at the time you call EnumProcessModules. To determine if the lphModule array is too small to hold all module handles for the process, compare the value returned in lpcbNeeded with the value specified in cb. If lpcbNeeded is greater than cb, increase the size of the array and call EnumProcessModules again.
            To determine how many modules were enumerated by the call to EnumProcessModules, divide the resulting value in the lpcbNeeded parameter by sizeof(HMODULE).

            <summary>
            Specifies the number of bits-per-pixel. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap. This member must be one of the following values. 
            Value Meaning 
            0 Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: The number of bits-per-pixel is specified or is implied by the JPEG or PNG format.  
            1 The bitmap is monochrome, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains two entries. Each bit in the bitmap array represents a pixel. If the bit is clear, the pixel is displayed with the color of the first entry in the bmiColors table; if the bit is set, the pixel has the color of the second entry in the table. 
            4 The bitmap has a maximum of 16 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains up to 16 entries. Each pixel in the bitmap is represented by a 4-bit index into the color table. For example, if the first byte in the bitmap is 0x1F, the byte represents two pixels. The first pixel contains the color in the second table entry, and the second pixel contains the color in the sixteenth table entry. 
            8 The bitmap has a maximum of 256 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO contains up to 256 entries. In this case, each byte in the array represents a single pixel. 
            16 The bitmap has a maximum of 2^16 colors. If the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER is BI_RGB, the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each WORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel. The relative intensities of red, green, and blue are represented with five bits for each color component. The value for blue is in the least significant five bits, followed by five bits each for green and red. The most significant bit is not used. The bmiColors color table is used for optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the number of entries specified by the biClrUsed member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER. 
            If the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER is BI_BITFIELDS, the bmiColors member contains three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components, respectively, of each pixel. Each WORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel.
            Windows NT/Windows 2000/XP: When the biCompression member is BI_BITFIELDS, bits set in each DWORD mask must be contiguous and should not overlap the bits of another mask. All the bits in the pixel do not have to be used. 
            Windows 95/98/Me: When the biCompression member is BI_BITFIELDS, the system supports only the following 16bpp color masks: A 5-5-5 16-bit image, where the blue mask is 0x001F, the green mask is 0x03E0, and the red mask is 0x7C00; and a 5-6-5 16-bit image, where the blue mask is 0x001F, the green mask is 0x07E0, and the red mask is 0xF800.
            24 The bitmap has a maximum of 2^24 colors, and the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each 3-byte triplet in the bitmap array represents the relative intensities of blue, green, and red, respectively, for a pixel. The bmiColors color table is used for optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the number of entries specified by the biClrUsed member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER.  
            32 The bitmap has a maximum of 2^32 colors. If the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER is BI_RGB, the bmiColors member of BITMAPINFO is NULL. Each DWORD in the bitmap array represents the relative intensities of blue, green, and red, respectively, for a pixel. The high byte in each DWORD is not used. The bmiColors color table is used for optimizing colors used on palette-based devices, and must contain the number of entries specified by the biClrUsed member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER. 
            If the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER is BI_BITFIELDS, the bmiColors member contains three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components, respectively, of each pixel. Each DWORD in the bitmap array represents a single pixel.
            Windows NT/ 2000: When the biCompression member is BI_BITFIELDS, bits set in each DWORD mask must be contiguous and should not overlap the bits of another mask. All the bits in the pixel do not need to be used.
            Windows 95/98/Me: When the biCompression member is BI_BITFIELDS, the system supports only the following 32-bpp color mask: The blue mask is 0x000000FF, the green mask is 0x0000FF00, and the red mask is 0x00FF0000.

            Specifies the type of compression for a compressed bottom-up bitmap (top-down DIBs cannot be compressed). This member can be one of the following values. 
            Value Description 
            BI_RGB An uncompressed format. 
            BI_RLE8 A run-length encoded (RLE) format for bitmaps with 8 bpp. The compression format is a 2-byte format consisting of a count byte followed by a byte containing a color index. For more information, see Bitmap Compression.  
            BI_RLE4 An RLE format for bitmaps with 4 bpp. The compression format is a 2-byte format consisting of a count byte followed by two word-length color indexes. For more information, see Bitmap Compression. 
            BI_BITFIELDS Specifies that the bitmap is not compressed and that the color table consists of three DWORD color masks that specify the red, green, and blue components, respectively, of each pixel. This is valid when used with 16- and 32-bpp bitmaps. 
            BI_JPEG Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Indicates that the image is a JPEG image. 
            BI_PNG Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Indicates that the image is a PNG image.

            Specifies the number of color indexes in the color table that are actually used by the bitmap. If this value is zero, the bitmap uses the maximum number of colors corresponding to the value of the biBitCount member for the compression mode specified by biCompression. 
            If biClrUsed is nonzero and the biBitCount member is less than 16, the biClrUsed member specifies the actual number of colors the graphics engine or device driver accesses. If biBitCount is 16 or greater, the biClrUsed member specifies the size of the color table used to optimize performance of the system color palettes. If biBitCount equals 16 or 32, the optimal color palette starts immediately following the three DWORD masks. 
            When the bitmap array immediately follows the BITMAPINFO structure, it is a packed bitmap. Packed bitmaps are referenced by a single pointer. Packed bitmaps require that the biClrUsed member must be either zero or the actual size of the color table.

            <summary>
            <para>The IServiceProvider interface is a generic access mechanism to locate a GUID-identified service that is provided through a control or any other object that the service can communicate with. For example, an embedded object (such as an OLE control) typically communicates only with its associated client site object in the container through the IOleClientSite interface that is supplied by using IOleObject::SetClientSite. The embedded object must ask the client site for some other service that the container supports when that service might not be implemented in the client site.</para>
            <para>The client site must provide a means by which the control that is managed by the site can access the service when necessary. For example, the IOleInPlaceSite::GetWindowContext function can be used by an in-place object or control to access interface pointers for the document object that contains the site and the frame object that contains the document. Because these interface pointers exist on separate objects, the control cannot call the site's QueryInterface to obtain those pointers. Instead, use the IServiceProvider interface. </para>
            <para>The IServiceProvider interface has only one member, QueryService, through which a caller specifies the service ID (SID, a GUID), the IID of the interface to return, and the address of the caller's interface pointer variable. </para>

            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

            OleAut32.dll functions.
            Must be 64bit-safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

        <member name="M:JetBrains.Interop.WinApi.OleAut32Dll.VariantClear(System.Void*)">
             <summary>
             Clears a variant.
             </summary>
             <param name="pvarg">Pointer to the <c>VARIANTARG</c> to clear.</param>
             <returns>The return value obtained from the returned HRESULT is one of the following.</returns>
             <remarks>
             Use this function to clear variables of type VARIANTARG (or VARIANT) before the memory containing the VARIANTARG is freed (as when a local variable goes out of scope). 
            
             The function clears a VARIANTARG by setting the vt field to VT_EMPTY. The current contents of the VARIANTARG are released first. If the vtfield is VT_BSTR, the string is freed. If the vtfield is VT_DISPATCH, the object is released. If the vt field has the VT_ARRAY bit set, the array is freed. 
            
             If the variant to be cleared is a COM object that is passed by reference, the vtfield of the pvargparameter is VT_DISPATCH | VT_BYREF or VT_UNKNOWN | VT_BYREF. In this case, VariantClear does not release the object. Because the variant being cleared is a pointer to a reference to an object, VariantClear has no way to determine if it is necessary to release the object. It is therefore the responsibility of the caller to release the object or not, as appropriate. 
            
             In certain cases, it may be preferable to clear a variant in code without calling VariantClear. For example, you can change the type of a VT_I4 variant to another type without calling this function. Safearrays of BSTR will have SysFreeString called on each element not VariantClear. However, you must call VariantClear if a VT_type is received but cannot be handled. Safearrays of variant will also have VariantClear called on each member. Using VariantClear in these cases ensures that code will continue to work if Automation adds new variant types in the future. 
            
             Do not use VariantClear on unitialized variants; use VariantInit to initialize a new VARIANTARG or VARIANT. 
            
             Variants containing arrays with outstanding references cannot be cleared. Attempts to do so will return an HRESULT containing DISP_E_ARRAYISLOCKED.

            <param name="pvarg">Pointer to the VARIANTARG that will be initialized.</param>
            <remarks>The VariantInit function initializes the VARIANTARG by setting the vt field to VT_EMPTY. Unlike VariantClear, this function does not interpret the current contents of the VARIANTARG. Use VariantInit to initialize new local variables of type VARIANTARG (or VARIANT). </remarks>

This is not the same as granting access to everyone by assigning a NULL discretionary access control list (DACL). The default security descriptor is based on the default DACL of the access token belonging to the calling process. By default, the default DACL in the access token of a process allows access only to the user represented by the access token. If other users must access the object, you can either create a security descriptor with the appropriate access, or add ACEs to the DACL that grants access to a group of users.

            User32.dll functions.
            Must be 64bit-safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

            Kernel32.dll functions.
            Must be 64bit-safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

If the buffer is too small to hold the module name, the string is truncated to nSize characters including the terminating null character, the function returns nSize, and the function sets the last error to ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER. 
            Windows XP/2000:  If the buffer is too small to hold the module name, the function returns nSize. The last error code remains ERROR_SUCCESS. If nSize is zero, the return value is zero and the last error code is ERROR_SUCCESS.

            <summary>
            Saves, as a bitmap, the portion of the screen image obscured by a window of this class. When the window is removed, the system uses the saved bitmap to restore the screen image, including other windows that were obscured. Therefore, the system does not send WM_PAINT messages to windows that were obscured if the memory used by the bitmap has not been discarded and if other screen actions have not invalidated the stored image. This style is useful for small windows (for example, menus or dialog boxes) that are displayed briefly and then removed before other screen activity takes place. This style increases the time required to display the window, because the system must first allocate memory to store the bitmap.

            Must be 64bit-safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

            It is only necessary to call DestroyIcon for icons and cursors created with the following functions: CreateIconFromResourceEx (if called without the LR_SHARED flag), CreateIconIndirect, and CopyIcon. Do not use this function to destroy a shared icon. A shared icon is valid as long as the module from which it was loaded remains in memory. The following functions obtain a shared icon: LoadIcon, LoadImage (if you use the LR_SHARED flag), CopyImage (if you use the LR_COPYRETURNORG flag and the hImage parameter is a shared icon), CreateIconFromResource, CreateIconFromResourceEx (if you use the LR_SHARED flag)

            The DestroyWindow function destroys the specified window. The function sends WM_DESTROY and WM_NCDESTROY messages to the window to deactivate it and remove the keyboard focus from it. The function also destroys the window's menu, flushes the thread message queue, destroys timers, removes clipboard ownership, and breaks the clipboard viewer chain (if the window is at the top of the viewer chain). If the specified window is a parent or owner window, DestroyWindow automatically destroys the associated child or owned windows when it destroys the parent or owner window. The function first destroys child or owned windows, and then it destroys the parent or owner window. DestroyWindow also destroys modeless dialog boxes created by the CreateDialog function.

            The EnumThreadWindows function enumerates all nonchild windows associated with a thread by passing the handle to each window, in turn, to an application-defined callback function. EnumThreadWindows continues until the last window is enumerated or the callback function returns FALSE. To enumerate child windows of a particular window, use the EnumChildWindows function.

            <returns>If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.  If EnumWindowsProc returns zero, the return value is also zero. In this case, the callback function should call SetLastError to obtain a meaningful error code to be returned to the caller of EnumWindows. </returns>
            <remarks>
            The EnumWindows function does not enumerate child windows, with the exception of a few top-level windows owned by the system that have the WS_CHILD style.
            This function is more reliable than calling the GetWindow function in a loop. An application that calls GetWindow to perform this task risks being caught in an infinite loop or referencing a handle to a window that has been destroyed.

            The GetKeyState function retrieves the status of the specified virtual key. The status specifies whether the key is up, down, or toggled (on, off—alternating each time the key is pressed). 
            </summary>
            <param name="nVirtKey">
            [in] Specifies a virtual key. If the desired virtual key is a letter or digit (A through Z, a through z, or 0 through 9), nVirtKey must be set to the ASCII value of that character. For other keys, it must be a virtual-key code.
            If a non-English keyboard layout is used, virtual keys with values in the range ASCII A through Z and 0 through 9 are used to specify most of the character keys. For example, for the German keyboard layout, the virtual key of value ASCII O (0x4F) refers to the "o" key, whereas VK_OEM_1 refers to the "o with umlaut" key.
            </param>
            <returns>
            The return value specifies the status of the specified virtual key, as follows:
            • If the high-order bit is 1, the key is down; otherwise, it is up.
            • If the low-order bit is 1, the key is toggled. A key, such as the CAPS LOCK key, is toggled if it is turned on. The key is off and untoggled if the low-order bit is 0. A toggle key's indicator light (if any) on the keyboard will be on when the key is toggled, and off when the key is untoggled.

            <param name="hWnd">[in] Handle to the window whose messages are to be retrieved. The window must belong to the current thread. If hWnd is NULL, GetMessage retrieves messages for any window that belongs to the current thread, and any messages on the current thread's message queue whose hwnd value is NULL (see the MSG structure). Therefore if hWnd is NULL, both window messages and thread messages are processed. If hWnd is -1, GetMessage retrieves only messages on the current thread's message queue whose hwnd value is NULL, that is, thread messages as posted by PostMessage (when the hWnd parameter is NULL) or PostThreadMessage.</param>
            <param name="wMsgFilterMin">[in] Specifies the integer value of the lowest message value to be retrieved. Use WM_KEYFIRST to specify the first keyboard message or WM_MOUSEFIRST to specify the first mouse message. Windows XP: Use WM_INPUT here and in wMsgFilterMax to specify only the WM_INPUT messages. If wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax are both zero, GetMessage returns all available messages (that is, no range filtering is performed).</param>
            <param name="wMsgFilterMax">[in] Specifies the integer value of the highest message value to be retrieved. Use WM_KEYLAST to specify the last keyboard message or WM_MOUSELAST to specify the last mouse message. Windows XP: Use WM_INPUT here and in wMsgFilterMin to specify only the WM_INPUT messages. If wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax are both zero, GetMessage returns all available messages (that is, no range filtering is performed).</param>
            <returns>If the function retrieves a message other than WM_QUIT, the return value is nonzero. If the function retrieves the WM_QUIT message, the return value is zero. If there is an error, the return value is -1. For example, the function fails if hWnd is an invalid window handle or lpMsg is an invalid pointer.

            If hWnd is NULL, PeekMessage retrieves messages for any window that belongs to the current thread, and any messages on the current thread's message queue whose hwnd value is NULL (see the MSG structure). Therefore if hWnd is NULL, both window messages and thread messages are processed.
            If hWnd is -1, PeekMessage retrieves only messages on the current thread's message queue whose hwnd value is NULL, that is, thread messages as posted by PostMessage (when the hWnd parameter is NULL) or PostThreadMessage.
            </param>
            <param name="wMsgFilterMin">[in] Specifies the value of the first message in the range of messages to be examined. Use WM_KEYFIRST to specify the first keyboard message or WM_MOUSEFIRST to specify the first mouse message. If wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax are both zero, PeekMessage returns all available messages (that is, no range filtering is performed).</param>
            <param name="wMsgFilterMax">[in] Specifies the value of the last message in the range of messages to be examined. Use WM_KEYLAST to specify the last keyboard message or WM_MOUSELAST to specify the last mouse message. If wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax are both zero, PeekMessage returns all available messages (that is, no range filtering is performed).</param>
            <param name="wRemoveMsg">[in] Specifies how messages are handled. This parameter can be one of the following values. PM_NOREMOVE Messages are not removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage. PM_REMOVE Messages are removed from the queue after processing by PeekMessage. You can optionally combine the value PM_NOYIELD with either PM_NOREMOVE or PM_REMOVE. This flag prevents the system from releasing any thread that is waiting for the caller to go idle (see WaitForInputIdle). By default, all message types are processed. To specify that only certain message should be processed, specify one or more of the following values. PM_QS_INPUT Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process mouse and keyboard messages. PM_QS_PAINT Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process paint messages. PM_QS_POSTMESSAGE Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Process all posted messages, including timers and hotkeys.

            The SetFocus function sets the keyboard focus to the specified window. The window must be attached to the calling thread's message queue. The SetFocus function sends a WM_KILLFOCUS message to the window that loses the keyboard focus and a WM_SETFOCUS message to the window that receives the keyboard focus. It also activates either the window that receives the focus or the parent of the window that receives the focus. If a window is active but does not have the focus, any key pressed will produce the WM_SYSCHAR, WM_SYSKEYDOWN, or WM_SYSKEYUP message. If the VK_MENU key is also pressed, the lParam parameter of the message will have bit 30 set. Otherwise, the messages produced do not have this bit set. By using the AttachThreadInput function, a thread can attach its input processing to another thread. This allows a thread to call SetFocus to set the keyboard focus to a window attached to another thread's message queue.

            The SetParent function changes the parent window of the specified child window. 
            An application can use the SetParent function to set the parent window of a pop-up, overlapped, or child window. The new parent window and the child window must belong to the same application. If the window identified by the hWndChild parameter is visible, the system performs the appropriate redrawing and repainting. For compatibility reasons, SetParent does not modify the WS_CHILD or WS_POPUP window styles of the window whose parent is being changed. Therefore, if hWndNewParent is NULL, you should also clear the WS_CHILD bit and set the WS_POPUP style after calling SetParent. Conversely, if hWndNewParent is not NULL and the window was previously a child of the desktop, you should clear the WS_POPUP style and set the WS_CHILD style before calling SetParent. Windows 2000/XP: When you change the parent of a window, you should synchronize the UISTATE of both windows. For more information, see WM_CHANGEUISTATE and WM_UPDATEUISTATE.

As long as the hDlg parameter specifies a parent window and the child window has a unique identifier (as specified by the hMenu parameter in the CreateWindow or CreateWindowEx function that created the child window), GetDlgItem returns a valid handle to the child window.</remarks>

            Declarations for the UxTheme.Dll.
            Must be 64bit-compatible.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            IMPORTANT! Rules for authoring the class (v1.1):
            (1) All the function declarations MUST be 64-bit aware.
            (2) When copypasting from older declarations, you MUST check against the MSDN help or header declaration, 
               and you MUST ensure that each parameter has a proper size.
            (3) Call the Wide version of the functions (UCS-2-LE) unless there's a strong reason for calling the ANSI version 
               (such a reason MUST be indicated in XmlDoc). <c>CharSet = CharSet.Unicode</c>.
            (4) ExactSpelling MUST be TRUE. Add the "…W" suffix wherever needed.
            (5) SetLastError SHOULD be considered individually for each function. Setting it to <c>True</c> allows to report the errors,
               but slows down the execution of critical members.
            (6) These properties MUST be explicitly set on DllImport attributes of EACH import: 
               CharSet, PreserveSig, SetLastError, ExactSpelling.
            (7) CLR names MUST be used for types instead of C# ones, eg "Int32" not "int" and "Int64" not "long".
               This greately improves the understanding of the parameter sizes.
            (8) Sign of the types MUST be favored, eg "DWORD" is "UInt32" not "Int32".
            (9) Unsafe pointer types should be used for explicit and implicit pointers rather than IntPtr. 
               This way we outline the unsafety of the native calls, and also make it more clear for the 64bit transition.
               Eg "HANDLE" is "void*". If the rule forces you to mark some assembly as unsafe, it's an indication a managed utility
               incapsulating the call and the handle should be provided in one of the already-unsafe assemblies.
            (A) Same rules must apply to members of the structures.
            (B) All of the structures MUST have the [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)], [NoReorder] attributes, as appropriate.

            <summary>
            The RECT structure defines the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of a rectangle.
            By convention, the right and bottom edges of the rectangle are normally considered exclusive. In other words, the pixel whose coordinates are (right, bottom) lies immediately outside of the the rectangle. For example, when RECT is passed to the FillRect function, the rectangle is filled up to, but not including, the right column and bottom row of pixels. This structure is identical to the RECTL structure.

            <summary>
            This flag is set when the bitmap has an Alpha channel (that is, per-pixel alpha). Note that the APIs use premultiplied alpha, which means that the red, green and blue channel values in the bitmap must be premultiplied with the alpha channel value. For example, if the alpha channel value is x, the red, green and blue channels must be multiplied by x and divided by 0xff prior to the call.
