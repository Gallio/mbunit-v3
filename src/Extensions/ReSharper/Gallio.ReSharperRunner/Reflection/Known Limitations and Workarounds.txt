RESHARPER 3.1
=============

Metadata API:

1. Need a way to get the MetadataLoader.

Workaround:
  Use reflection to grab the loader out of the assembly.

Recommendation:
  Provide the MetadataLoader to the UTE during ExploreAssembly.


2. UnresolvedTypeInfo and UnresolvedMethodInfo objects are problematic.
  It turns out that the reader API does not try to resolve MemberRefs across assemblies.
  So in particular, if the UsedConstructor of an IMetadataAttribute is defined in another
  assembly, I get an UnresolvedMethodInfo.

Workaround:
  Detect them using reflection tricks and resolve them manually by loading up
  the right assembly and finding the appropriate object given the full type name, method
  name and method signature.

Recommendation:
  Always resolve MemberRefs if possible.  Provide a mechanism for adding
  fallback rules to a MetadataLoader or for detecting and resolving unresolved metadata
  objects on demand.


3. The MetadataLoader provided to the UTE during ExploreAssembly does not take into
account non-copylocal assembly references.

Workaround:
  When we encounter an assembly reference we can't load, go looking at the
  IAssemblyReferences of the IProject provided to the UTE during ExploreAssembly.
  Use MetadataLoader.LoadFrom to get these additional references.

Recommendation:
  Add more paths to the MetadataLoader ahead of time so that anything that is referenced
  by the test assembly project is accessible.  Include stuff in the GAC too, if possible.


4. The UsedConstructor property of IMetadataAssembly can sometimes be null.  No clue why.

Workaround:
  Ignore such attributes.


5. IMetadataAssembly.GetTypeFromQualifiedName returns an unresolved type instead of null
  when it cannot find the type.

Workaround:
  Check for an unresolved type.
  
Recommendation:
  Just return null, or find some better way to signal the fact that the type was not found.


PSI API:

1. There is no IDeclaredElement associated with a method return value.
  Consequently the attributes for a return value are mixed in with those of the
  method itself.
  
Workaround:
  None.  Method return attributes may confuse the test runner as it builds
  the test tree and find attributes applied to methods that really shouldn't be there
  (but could have appeared on a return parameter).
  
Recommendation:
  Should really add support for return values as distinct declared elements.
  

2. Generic parameter attributes are not supported.
  I think they just disappear from the Psi model.

Workaround:
  None.  We will be unable to detect data binding to generic type and method parameters.
  This could cause the test tree to be missing some information.  Probably harmless.
  
Recommendation:
  Support attributes on generic parameters.


3. Positional parameters of attributes with variable numbers of arguments do not
  group the varargs values together into an array.

Workaround:
  Detect when the last parameter has IsParamArray then reshuffle the positional
  parameters of the attribute such that all of the final parameter values become
  members of an array.
  
Recommendation:
  This might actually be reasonable behavior for R# but perhaps it can be improved a little.
  

4. There is no way to just enumerate all named parameter values for attributes.

Workaround:
  Enumerate all fields and properties of the attribute type and call
  IAttributeInstance.NamedParameter for each one to get its value.
  
Recommendation:
  Would be good to expose the collection of properties and fields for which
  values have been provided.  The IAttributeInstance implementation already
  knows this.


5. Cannot obtain arrays of constants from an IAttributeInstance.
  Also, certain TypeofExpressions yield bad ConstantValue2 objects when they contain
  references to non-predefined types.

Workaround:
  Dig into the C# Psi implementation to pull out what we need from the raw
    expressions.
  Not sure what to do for VisualBasic.  Probably the same thing.

Recommendation:
  Produce suitable ConstantValue2 objects for all types and arrays.
  
  
6. IFunction.HidePolicy sometimes returns the wrong value when it should be HIDE_BY_SIGNATURE.
  Not sure what causes this.  This is important for determining how method hiding
  works during reflection.  In C# it should always be true, so it shouldn't be too
  problematic for us there.

Workaround:
  Ignoring it.  Assume it's always true.

Recommendation:
  Ensure this property is set correctly.  It should probably always be HIDE_BY_SIGNATURE
  except when importing from metadata.


7. IFunction has no way to specify VarArgs calling convention.  This is mostly significant
  for rederiving the calling conventions of C++ code that has been linked in.
  
Workaround:
  Not supporting it.  Make a guess about calling conventions.
  
Recommendation:
  When the IFunction has just been read from metadata, we could grab the calling conventions
  from there.  Of course VarArgs doesn't really mean anything to C# so this might not be all that
  useful to R#.
  

8. Finalizers don't seem to show up.
  Not quite sure what's up here.  Might only affect types imported from metadata.
  Needs more investigation.
  
Workaround:
  Not supporting it.
