    <para>
    Sets the filter expression to apply, which consists of one or more filter
    rules that may be combined using 'and', 'or', and 'not' and grouped with
    parentheses. A filter rule consists of a filter key followed by one or
    more comma-delimited matching values in the form 'key: value, "quoted value",
    /regular expression/'.

      The filter grammar is defined as follows:

     OR               ::= "or"                   # Not case-sensitive
     AND              ::= "and"                  # Not case-sensitive
     NOT              ::= "not"                  # Not case-sensitive

     <quotedWord>     ::= '"' .* '"'             # String delimited by double quotation marks
                      | "'" .* "'"               # String delimited by single quotation marks

    </para>
    <list type="bullet">
      <item>By default this property takes the value "*", which means the "Any" filter will be applied.</item>
      <item>
        The operator precedence is, from highest to lowest: NOT, AND, and OR. All these operators are
        left-associative.
      </item>
      <item>
        The commas used to separate the values are interpreted as OR operators, so "Type:Fixture1,Fixture2"
        is equivalent to "Type:Fixture1 or Type:Fixture2".
      </item>
      <item>
        White-space is ignored outside quoted strings, so "Type:Fixture1|Type:Fixture2" is equivalent
        to "Type : Fixture1 | Type : Fixture2".
      </item>
      <item>
        Commas, colons, slashes, backslashes and quotation marks can be escaped with a backslash. For
        example, \' will be interpreted as '. Using a single backslash in front of any other character
        is invalid.

        Currently the following filter keys are recognized:
        <list type="bullet">

          <item>Name: Filter by name.</item>
          <item>Assembly: Filter by assembly name.</item>
          <item>Namespace: Filter by namespace name.</item>
