* Use a publisher policy file in the GAC to silently redirect clients to
  newer versions of MbUnit.

* Import XML documentation from test assemblies into the test tree as
  metadata.  The docs can then be presented in the test runner.  Writing
  XML docs is much more natural than using the [Description] attribute.
  However, since most tests are not documented, the user will have to tell
  the C# compiler to ignore warning 1591 about missing documentation on
  visible members.

* Allow the TestGraph to be updated at runtime.  It should be possible to
  cancel tests previously added and to add new tests and ensure they are
  scheduled to run accordingly.
  
  Use case 1: User decides to cancel a whole bunch of tests interactively
              after observing intermediate results.  However, the entire
              run of tests should not be abandoned.
              
              Caveat: Abandoning the tests altogether is easier and quite
                      effective in most circumstances.
              
  Use case 2: User decides to add a few more cases during a long test run
              in response to intermediate observations.  This is especially
              useful for system testing scnearios.
              
              Caveat: An alternate solution is to provide affordances that
                      make it easy for a user to batch up a new test run.
                      This is particularly convenient when working with remote
                      test agents that can perhaps run all of the tests in parallel.
                      
  Use case 3: The system is unable to determine a-priori what all of the
              tests to run will be.  Possibly the set of tests or the parameters
              for the tests are determined at runtime based on prior test
              executions.
              
              Caveat: Explicit test batch sequencing can accomplish this
                      quite neatly but it's somewhat more inconvenient for the
                      user.  Interim results may need to be saved to a file
                      so they can be reloaded as test parameters in the test
                      iteration.
                      
                      A few years ago I'd have laughed off this idea, but
                      I've seen people do weird things with xUnit frameworks
                      (particularly for system testing) that make it difficult
                      to obtain a-priori knowledge.
                      
  Use case 4: A test framework is to be integrated that does not support
              the two-pass runtime model with test enumeration being
              separate from test execution.


* Custom attributes for integration with common testing tools.

  eg. Rhino.Mocks (in MbUnit.Framework.RhinoMocks)
      The MocksAttribute automatically adds initialization code to test setup
      to create a MockRepository and adds a call to mocks.VerifyAll() in teardown.
      It might also gather extra Rhino.Mocks diagnostic output for the execution
      log (like a trace of mocked method calls, perhaps).

      [Mocks]
      private MockRepository mocks;
      
  eg. WatiN (in MbUnit.Framework.WatiN)
      The BrowserAttribute automatically adds initialization code to test setup
      to create a Browser and a call to browser.Dispose() in teardown.
      It could capture snapshots of all page loads and embed them in the execution
      log as HTML with attached resources, or just capture images.
  
      [Browser]
      private Browser browser;

* Add a command-line option to Echo and switches to the build tasks for
  NAnt report compatibility mode.  (Run our XML reports through XSLT to generate
  a compatible report.)  I'm not sure how useful this is in the long run though.
  
* Add switches to the build tasks for NCover integration and perhaps other
  profilers.

* Add Mixins.  A parameterized template could serve as the basis for inclusion
  in another template.
  
  eg. When testing collections, perhaps we could use mixins to abstract out
      various test patterns.
      
      [Mixin]
      [Bind("Instance")]
      public CollectionTester collectionTester;

      Or:
      
      [Mixin]
      public CollectionTester CollectionTests()
      {
          return new CollectionTester(instance);
      }
      
* Add Agent-driven tests.  An Agent is simply a worker that is started on its
  own thread by a test and automatically shut down when it terminates.  Exceptions
  thrown by an agent cause the test to fail.  Because agents belong to the same
  test fixture they can share global state.  This is useful for coordinating the
  actions of multiple concurrent agents.  Addtional primitives could be offered
  for synchronization too.
  
  eg. We want to test a blocking producer-consumer queue.  We can declare the test like this:
      
      [TestFixture]
      public class QueueTest
      {
          private Queue queue;
      
	      [Test]
	      public void ProducerConsumer()
	      {
	          queue = new Queue();
	          Agent.StartAll();
	      }
	      
	      [Agent]
	      public void Producer()
	      {
	          queue.Put("foo");
	          queue.Put("bar");
	      }
	      
	      [Agent]
	      public void Consumer()
	      {
	          Assert.AreEqual("foo", queue.Get());
	          Assert.AreEqual("bar", queue.Get());
	          Assert.IsFalse(queue.TryGetWithTimeout(1000));
	      }
	  }
	  
  eg. Test a SIP telephony stack.
  
      [TestFixture]
      public class SIPTest
      {	   
	      private SIPStack sip;
	      
	      [SetUp]
	      public void SetUpSIPStack()
	      {
	          sip = new SIPStack();
	      }
      
          [Test]   
          public void DialThenAnswerThenAnswererHangsUp()
          {
              Agent.Start("Dialer", false);
              Agent.Start("Answerer", true);
              Agent.JoinAll();
              
              CallRecord record = sip.GetCallRecord();
              Assert.AreEqual(CallTerminationState.AnswererHungUp, record.CallTerminationState);
          }

          [Test]   
          public void DialThenAnswerThenDialerHangsUp()
          {
              Agent.Start("Dialer", true);
              Agent.Start("Answerer", false);
              Agent.JoinAll();
              
              CallRecord record = GetCallRecord();
              Assert.AreEqual(CallTerminationState.DialerHungUp, record.CallTerminationState);
          }
      
	      [Agent]
	      public void Dialer(bool hangUp)
	      {
	          SIPEndpoint endpoint = sip.CreateSIPEndpoint("5.6.7.8");	          
	          Agent.WaitForSignal("AnswererReady");
	          
	          endpoint.Dial("1.2.3.4");
	          endpoint.WaitForAnswer();
	          
	          if (hangUp)
	              endpoint.HangUp();
	          else
		          endpoint.WaitForHangUp();
	      }
	      
	      [Agent]
	      public void Answerer(bool hangUp)
	      {
	          SIPEndpoint endpoint = sip.CreateSIPEndpoint("1.2.3.4");
	          Agent.Signal("AnswererReady");
	          
	          endpoint.WaitForCall();
	          Assert.AreEqual("5.6.7.8", endpoint.CallerIP);
	          endpoint.Answer();
	          
	          if (hangUp)
	              endpoint.HangUp();
	          else
		          endpoint.WaitForHangUp();
	      }
      }

  Possible primitives:
  
  - Start/Stop/Join/Kill agents.
  - Signals, Condition Variables, Barriers.
  - Provide events or declarative flags to specify how an agent should get cleaned up.
    (All lumped together here)
    
    [Agent(CleanUp = CleanUp.Abort)]
    [Agent(CleanUp = CleanUp.Interrupt)]
    [Agent(CleanUp = typeof(CustomType)]
    public void Agent()
    {
        Agent.Current.CleanUp += delegate { myService.Stop(); }
    }
    
    public class CustomType
    {
        public CleanUp(AgentHandle agent)
        {
            agent.Thread.SetLocalData(shutdownSlot, true);
        }
    }
 
  In simple cases we could provide a declarative mechanism for starting agents:
    [Test]
    [StartAgent("Producer"), StartAgent("Consumer")]
    public void Test() { }
